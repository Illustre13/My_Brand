          Success is the accomplishment of certain goals you set in life. Each
          person has different ideas of what success might look like for them,
          like getting a certain job, earning a certain amount of money or
          owning a house. Regardless of the goals, there are some steps you can
          take to be successful in your life. In this article, we discuss how
          you can measure success and outline the steps to be successful in
          life. 13 steps to be successful in life Here are 13 steps that can
          help you to be successful in life:
          <br />1. Find a passion To be successful, it is important to define
          what you want in life. Consider reading books or taking classes about
          different subjects until you find something that interests you.
          Finding an area you are passionate about helps you enjoy the steps you
          take towards achieving your goals. See if there are potential career
          opportunities in your passion to see if it is something you want to
          pursue. <br />2. Show commitment Commitment means dedicating yourself
          to becoming successful and working hard in all circumstances. Set both
          short- and long-term goals and take action every day toward these.
          Showing commitment can help keep you motivated while achieving these
          goals, especially as you complete tasks that contribute to your larger
          goals. These goals might be ambitious, but remember to set a realistic
          plan and timeline. For example, rather than setting a goal to complete
          college and start a new career in one year, allow yourself the time to
          complete your education and search for the right job. Share your
          personal commitments and goals with friends or family members. Others
          can motivate you through difficult times, and other people can make
          sure you remain accountable for your commitments and actions. <br />3.
          Learn from the journey Rather than focusing strictly on the results of
          your accomplishments, take notice of the small steps needed to achieve
          success. If you allow yourself to enjoy small victories along your
          journey, reaching your goals can feel more achievable, and you are
          more likely to stay on track. Each step you take can teach you lessons
          that you can apply to future goals and challenges. <br />4. Have fun
          along the way Be sure to enjoy the steps you take towards achieving
          your goals. Becoming successful can have some challenges, but having
          fun while learning new things and meeting new people can motivate you
          and make the journey enjoyable. Learning what you are capable of can
          be exciting, so it is important to keep your goals light and fun in
          order to have an emotionally positive experience.<br />5. Think
          positively It is important to keep a positive mindset and believe that
          you can achieve your goals. Positive thinking keeps your expectations
          high and reminds you of what is possible. Challenges may come, but
          remember that they are temporary and continue to believe you can
          succeed. If negative thoughts arise, replace them with positive ones.
          For example, if you think "I will never get this job", consider
          thinking "The right position is going to come." Give yourself the
          opportunity and the time to think about your situation, using only
          positive language to condition more positive thinking. <br />6. Be
          honest with yourself If you find your goal is at a standstill, you
          might need to be honest with yourself about the reasons. After you
          have come to an understanding, try to find a solution to push yourself
          toward success. Challenge yourself to try new strategies. This might
          mean speaking to a supervisor about a promotion, signing up for a
          difficult college class that you never considered before or exploring
          different industries to work. An honest review of your situation and
          goals allows you to make better decisions about the next steps.
          <br />7. Take away distractions Make a list of things in your life
          that take up your time or distract you. This could be a phone, a
          television show or even a person who causes you stress. If you set a
          certain amount of time each day to work towards your goal, be sure you
          avoid these common distractions. Eventually, as you continue to
          practise this dedication, you can improve your focus skills. This
          helps both on the journey to success and when working in future roles.
          <br />8. Depend on yourself It is important to depend on yourself by
          focusing on the actions you can take. This can assure you that despite
          challenges, you have tried your best. There are things out of your
          control, like the hiring process, but focusing on what you can control
          can help you continuously complete tasks and learn when you might need
          help. It is beneficial to rely on others for emotional support, but
          focusing your accountability on yourself can motivate you as you
          achieve success. Related: Self-Management Skills: Definition and
          Examples <br />9. Keep planning Stick to a schedule when working on
          your goals. Give yourself challenges according to your personal
          calendar, such as "I will finish a training course by the end of the
          year" or "I will try three new marketing strategies this quarter."
          Even if you do not achieve the goal as planned, you still track your
          progress. Industries, careers and education can change over time, so
          it is important to keep planning and adjust your goals as needed.

          <br />10. Avoid overworking It is important to focus on your goal and
          avoid burnout. Keeping your journey productive yet fun can ensure your
          motivation without overworking yourself. Your goal should be something
          that brings you continued joy and challenges rather than a burden.
          Consider taking breaks or achieving goals that are unrelated to your
          larger success goals. This can help you return to your task with a new
          perspective and be motivated to start working again. <br />11. Create
          SMART goals SMART goals are a goal-structuring technique that ensures
          you have concrete and actionable goals. The acronym means: Specific:
          Specific goals mean stating exactly what you want to achieve. Rather
          than simply saying you want to earn a promotion, specify what role you
          hope to attain. Measurable: Measurable goals have metrics you can use
          to track your progress. You might state you want to learn three new
          skills in a specific area and have a manager recognise your
          improvements. Attainable: Attainable goals are realistic. Rather than
          a goal of becoming a finance executive while still in school, an
          attainable goal might be to earn certain marks in your classes.
          Relevant: Relevant goals are those that are set with a larger goal in
          mind. For example, you may set a goal to complete a resume-writing
          class so that you can start a career as a professional resume writer.
          Time-based: Your goals are most effective if they have realistic
          timelines. Although schedules can change, having an anticipated
          completion date can help you stay motivated. SMART goals help you
          define clear goals early that you can refer to along your journey.
          Make a plan to set and review these goals frequently based on your
          experiences. Related: SMART Goals: Definition and Examples <br />12.
          Start small Though you set ambitious goals, starting with simple tasks
          can help you feel productive. Even writing down your goals can be your
          first accomplishment. Some small tasks you might consider towards
          building a successful life include: Sending a query email Editing your
          resume Contacting professionals in your network Reading an article
          about your goals Each completed task is already a successful
          achievement, no matter how small they are. <br />13. Build good habits
          Building good habits can help you achieve goals as well as learn
          important skills like focus, time management and attention to detail.
          Consider a morning or nighttime routine where you review your goals,
          set tasks you want to accomplish, and review your schedule. By doing
          this, you develop a routine that you can follow for any future goals.
          It is also important to prioritise rest and good mental health habits.
          Meditating for five minutes or exercising first thing in the morning
          can improve your focus and attitude and help you build your goals.
          Related: Time Management Skills: Definition and Examples How do you
          measure success? Depending on the goals you set, success can look
          different for every person. Here are some ways you might measure
          success: How happy you feel How much money you earn What career
          position you have How much influence you have How many people's lives
          you have influenced Where you live How healthy you are How fulfilling
          your career is For each of these, the metrics to define them can vary.
          It is important to know yourself and what you want rather than
          defining success by someone else's standards. For example, your idea
          of success might be a director role for a finance company, while
          someone else's might be to be an executive in that same industry.
